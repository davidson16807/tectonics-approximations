Trimorphous with Aragonite andVaterite.<p>Original sample description and visible-NIR spectrum was published in:<p>Hunt, G.R., J.W. Salisbury, 1971, Visible and near-infraredspectra of minerals and rocks:  II. Carbonates.  ModernGeology, v. 2, p. 23-30.<p>They said: "the sample appears colorless and mineralogically pure. Its spectrum  clearly displays the strong carbonate bands from 1.8 to 2.6&#181; as in the  sample above, which are common to most carbonates. It also displays a weak band  near 1.1&#181; and a fall-off in reflectivity less than 0.4&#181;, which  can be attributed to the presence of ferrous ion substituting in small amount  for calcium. An analysis of this sample shows that 0.09% of iron by weight is  present. This chemical and spectral behavior is quite typical of calcite. Again,  pilling of the finest size fraction probably produces the crossover of the spectral  curves in the visible."<p>The spectrum here indicates a pure calcite.  The sample appearswhite with no contaminants under a hand lens.<p>SeeClark, R.N., T.V.V. King, M. Klejwa, G. Swayze, and N.
