Aventurine Quartz. India (117B). Aventurine quartz is a rare variety  that has brilliant scales of mica or hematite distributed within it. This particular  sample has mica inclusions, as can be seen by comparing the hydroxyl bands near  1.4&#181; and between 2.2 and 2.6&#181; with those of muscovite. The very strong  band near 0.6&#181;m is not due to the muscovite. We do not know the origin  of this band. Some blue quartz which has been analyzed yields Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>  (0.5%) and small amounts of TiO<sub>2</sub> as impurities. A band has been observed  in some blue Beryl's at 0.62&#181;, but its origin has been attributed to Fe<sup>+2</sup>  in axial channels, and definitely not to Fe<sup>+2</sup> or Fe<sup>+3</sup>  in the Si tetrahedral site."<p>Sieve interval 74 - 250&#181;m.<p>Hunt, G.R., J.W.

Profile-based search-match returns quartz and the 2M1illite as the most likely phases.  Of all phlogopite and muscovite patterns inthe PDF2 database, only 2M1 muscovites (06-0263, 19-0814) give satisfactory fits.Weak reflections at 5.9 and 5.1 Angstroms were not identified.  A very weak peakappears at 7.1 Angstroms in the strip chart but was not resolved in the smootheddigital data.<p>END_XRD_ANALYSIS.<p>COMPOSITIONAL_ANALYSIS_TYPE: None      # XRF, EPMA, ICP(Trace), WChem<BR><BR>COMPOSITION_TRACE:<p>COMPOSITION_DISCUSSION:<p>END_COMPOSITION_DISCUSSION.<p>MICROSCOPIC_EXAMINATION:<p>END_MICROSCOPIC_EXAMINATION.<p>SPECTROSCOPIC_DISCUSSION:<p>END_SPECTROSCOPIC_DISCUSSION.<p>SPECTRAL_PURITY:  1b2_3_4_ # HS117.3B # 1= 0.2-3, 2= 1.5-6, 3= 6-25, 4= 20-150 microns<br></BODY></HTML>
