Salisbury, and C.J. Lenhoff, 1971, Visibleand near-infrared spectra of minerals and rocks:  III.Oxides  and hydroxides.  Modern Geology, v. 2, p. 195-205.<p>With the note: "Magnetite, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, is sometimes found inveins of large masses as a product of magmatic segregation, and asbeds or lenses in metamorphic rocks.  Most commonly, it is anaccessory mineral in igneous rocks, and it is frequently associatedwith the heavy fraction of beach and river sands because of itsresistance to weathering.  As in the case of this sample, magnetiteis typically an opaque spectrally featureless mineral in the visibleand near-infrared.  It contains both ferrous and ferric ion, and Al,V, and Cr may substitute for the Fe<sup>+3</sup>, while Ca, Mn, and Mg, Ni,Ca, and Zr may replace some Fe<sup>+2</sup>.  A considerable amount of Tican also enter the magnetite structure.  Except in rare cases ofsubstantial substitution, however, all magnetites display opaquebehavior.  This particular sample is titaniferous, and theexplanation for its opacity must be similar to that given forilmenite [HS231], with additional contributions being made to thegeneral absorption property by all the substituents present."<p>Grain size fractions are indicated by the extension after the sample number: <br>.1B = <5 &#181;m<br>.2B = <74 &#181;m<br>.3B = 74-250 &#181;m<br>.4B = 250-1200 &#181;m<br><p>IMAGE_OF_SAMPLE:<BR>.1B fraction <a href="photo_images/magnetite_hs78.1b_crw_0057_jfr.jpg"><img src="photo_thumbs/magnetite_hs78.1b_crw_0057_jfr.jpg" ALT="Photo of sample" width="100" height="67" border="0"></a><BR>.2B fraction <a href="photo_images/magnetite_hs78.2b_crw_0032_jfr.jpg"><img src="photo_thumbs/magnetite_hs78.2b_crw_0032_jfr.jpg" ALT="Photo of sample" width="100" height="67" border="0"></a><BR>.3B fraction <a href="photo_images/magnetite_hs78.3b_crw_0019_jfr.jpg"><img src="photo_thumbs/magnetite_hs78.3b_crw_0019_jfr.jpg" ALT="Photo of sample" width="100" height="67" border="0"></a><BR>.4B fraction <a href="photo_images/magnetite_hs78.4b_crw_0051_jfr.jpg"><img src="photo_thumbs/magnetite_hs78.4b_crw_0051_jfr.jpg" ALT="Photo of sample" width="100" height="67" border="0"></a><br><p>END_SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION.<p><p>XRD_ANALYSIS:<p>40 kV - 30 mA, 7.3-9.5 keV <br>File:  magnt78.mdi (bulk sample); magnt78b.mdi; magnt78c.mdi (non-magnetic fraction)(All smears on quartz plate) <br>References:  Huebner's reference patterns; PDF2 #10-0393, 16-0344, 17-0464, 18-1202,19-0629, 19-1184, 29-0733, 33-1161, 34-0192; Deer, Howie, and Zussman (1962) <br>Found:  Fe-rich spinel, plagioclase; traces of ilmenite, Al-rich spinel, mica, andquartz <br><br>Comments:  Pattern of bulk material consists of a set of broad, moderate to strongpeaks with no resolution of alpha1-alpha2 and a second set of sharp, weak tomoderate peaks, some with good resolution of alpha1-alpha2.  The major phase isface-centered cubic with 8.40 Angstrom cell edge, consistent with magnetite (ormagnesioferrite or a spinel-group solid solution).  The non-magnetic fraction wasdeciphered using pattern magnt78c.mdi.  The ilmenite has lattice spacings closeto those of endmember FeTiO3 and the second FCC phase has an 8.13 Angstrom celledge, consistent with hercynite or spinel (the species, MgAl2O4).  Reflections at2.79 and 2.27 Angstroms were not identified.  The ragged peak between 8.5 and 7.9Angstroms is assumed to be instrumental because it appears in other patterns.<p><p><p>END_XRD_ANALYSIS.<p>COMPOSITIONAL_ANALYSIS_TYPE:  None         # XRF, EPMA, ICP(Trace), WChem<BR>COMPOSITION_TRACE:<p>COMPOSITION_DISCUSSION:<p>None.<p>END_COMPOSITION_DISCUSSION.<p>MICROSCOPIC_EXAMINATION:<p><p>END_MICROSCOPIC_EXAMINATION.<p>SPECTROSCOPIC_DISCUSSION:<p>END_SPECTROSCOPIC_DISCUSSION.<p>SPECTRAL_PURITY: 1b2_3_4_ # HS78.1B # 1= 0.2-3, 2= 1.5-6, 3= 6-25, 4= 20-150 microns<br>SPECTRAL_PURITY: 1b2_3_4_ # HS78.2B # 1= 0.2-3, 2= 1.5-6, 3= 6-25, 4= 20-150 microns<br>SPECTRAL_PURITY: 1b2b3b4u # HS78.3B # 1= 0.2-3, 2= 1.5-6, 3= 6-25, 4= 20-150 microns<br>SPECTRAL_PURITY: 1b2_3_4_ # HS78.4B # 1= 0.2-3, 2= 1.5-6, 3= 6-25, 4= 20-150 microns<br></BODY></HTML>
