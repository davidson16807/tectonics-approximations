Salisbury, and C.J. Lenhoff, 1971, Visibleand near-infrared spectra of minerals and rocks:  III.Oxides  and hydroxides.  Modern Geology, v. 2, p. 195-205.<p>With the note:"Like cuprite, goethite displays trans-opaquebehavior, but does so at a slightly shorter wavelength (near0.55&#181;m).  The ferric ion itself produces the feature near 0.9,and the fall-off short of 0.55&#181;m is explained as being due to thepresence of a conduction band with a quite well-resolved absorptionedge, which is typical of the trans-opaque iron oxides.  It shouldbe noted in particular that goethite displays no hydroxyl bands inthe near-infrared, despite its traditional formula, FeO-OH.  Likediaspore (see above), the pure mineral should contain no freehydroxyl groups (Ewing, 1935)."<p>Grain size fractions are indicated by the extension after the sample number: <br>.3B = 74-250 &#181;m<br>.3  = 74-250 &#181;m (compared to .3B, a grinding process was used which resulted in trace metal shavings from grinder)<br><p>IMAGE_OF_SAMPLE:<BR>NO PHOTO<br><p>END_SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION.<p><p>XRD_ANALYSIS:<p>40 kV - 30 mA, 7.3-9.5 keV <br>File: gotht36_mdi, *.out (smear mount on quartz plate) <br>References: Huebner's reference patterns <br>Found: goethite, minor quartz, unidentified reflection at  <br><br>Comment: Goethite reflections are moderately sharp, indicating moderate degree ofcrystallinity.
