Salisbury, and C.J. Lenhoff, 1971, Visibleand near-infrared spectra of minerals and rocks:  III.Oxides  and hydroxides.  Modern Geology, v. 2, p. 195-205.<p>With the note that "this sample departs considerably from a purestoichiometric single crystal, but is typical of naturally occurringhematite."<p>The sample measured for the library was HS45.3 which was dry sievedto the grain size interval 74-250&#181;m. Compared to .3B samples, a grinding process was used which resulted in trace metal shavings from grinder.<p>IMAGE_OF_SAMPLE:<BR>NO PHOTO<br><p>END_SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION.<p><p>XRD_ANALYSIS:<p>40 kV - 30 mA, 7.3-9.5 keV<br>File: hemat45.mdi, *.out (smear mount on quartz plate)<br>References: Huebner's reference patterns<br>Found: Hematite; traces of quartz and a 7 Angstrom phase<br><br>Comment: Strong, narrow, symmetric hematite reflectionsindicate excellent crystallinity and suggest compositional heterogeneity.Hematite peak positions are consistent with Fe2O3 composition.  Thequartz identification is based upon two very weak (and broad) reflections.  Veryweak reflections at 7.2 and 3.55 Angstroms indicate the presence of a 7or 14 Angstroms phase (possibly chlorite).<p>J.S. Huebner, J. Pickrell, and T.
