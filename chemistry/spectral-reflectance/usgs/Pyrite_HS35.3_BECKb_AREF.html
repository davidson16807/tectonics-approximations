Dimorphous with Marcasite.<p>"SS-19.  Pyrite.  Rico, Colorado (35).  Pyrite, FeS<sub>2</sub>, is the mostcommon and widespread of sulphides.  It occurs in igneous, metamorphicand sedimentary rocks, as well as in veins.  In the visible, pyritedisplays the reflectivity vs.  particle size behavior that is peculiarto opaque minerals - ie.  reflectivity decreases as particle sizedecreases.  It is also interesting that decreased absorption in the redregion of the visible results in a significant contrast in reflectivityfrom the red to the blue, despite the sample's overall low reflectivity.In the near-infrared, the spectral behavior of pyrite changes from thatof an opaque material to that of a transparent one.  This sample iscontaminated with grinder steel, which is probably responsible for itslow reflectivity throughout.  The smallest grain size is the only onewhich shows a rise in reflectivity to longer wavelengths, producing whatappears to be an absorption edge between 1.1 and 1.5&#181;.  We feel,however, that this is an artifact of the contamination in this sample,and that it should display a weak ferrous ion band near 1&#181; likemarcasite, before changing from transparent to opaque behavior."<p>Sieve interval 74 - 250&#181;m.<p>Hunt, G.R., J.W.
