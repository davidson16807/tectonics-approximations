Salisbury,  and C.J. Lenhoff, 1971, Visible and near-infrared spectra of minerals and rocks:  IV. Sulfides and sulfates Modern Geology, v. 3, p. 1-14.<p>With the note: "It exhibits typical opaque behavior, decreasing in reflectivity  as its particle size is reduced. It is not, however, spectrally featureless.  A fall-off in the reflectivity toward the blue, together with a weak band near  0.9&#181;m, results in the characteristic brass-yellow color of this mineral.  Both spectral features are due to iron, which is present in chalcopyrite in  the trivalent state (Deer and others, 1962). The copper also makes a contribution  to the feature near 0.9&#181;m. This sample is contaminated with approximately  10% pyrrhotite, which has no appreciable effect on the spectrum."<p>Grain size fractions are indicated by the extension after the sample number: <br>.1B = <5 &#181;m<br>.2B = <74 &#181;m<br>.3B = 74-250 &#181;m<br>.4B = 250-1200 &#181;m<br><p>IMAGE_OF_SAMPLE:<BR><a href="photo_images/chalcopyrite_hs4231_3b_crw_0010_jfr.jpg"><img src="photo_thumbs/chalcopyrite_hs4231_3b_crw_0010_jfr.jpg" ALT="Photo of sample" width="100" height="67" border="0"></a><br><p>END_SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION.<p><p>XRD_ANALYSIS:<p>40 kV - 30 mA, 7.3-9.5 keV <br>File: chpyr431_mdi, *.out (smear mount on quartz plate) <br>References: JCPDS #37-471, #5-566; Huebner's reference patterns <br>Found: Chalcopyrite, minor sphalerite <br><br>  Comment: Moderately sharp, symmetrical peaks suggest moderate crystallinity  and compositional heterogeneity.
