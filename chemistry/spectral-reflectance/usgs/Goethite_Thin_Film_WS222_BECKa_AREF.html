Impurities were  removed prior to grinding. This fine grained powder was mixed with water and  an eye-dropper was used to deposit a thin coating on a microscope glass thin  section. The sample was dried over night and them measured spectrally. Our goal  was to unsaturate the goethite bands and mimic the spectral absorptions found  in natural goethite coatings.<p>END_SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION.<p><p>XRD_ANALYSIS:<p>Goethite<br>Perhaps some quartz<p>Konnert, Judith and Marta Flohr, 1992, unpublished data, U.S.G.S.Reston, VA.<p>END_XRD_ANALYSIS.<p>COMPOSITIONAL_ANALYSIS_TYPE:  None      # XRF, EPMA, ICP(Trace), WChem<P>COMPOSITION_TRACE: None<p>COMPOSITION_DISCUSSION:<p>None.<p>END_COMPOSITION_DISCUSSION.<p>MICROSCOPIC_EXAMINATION:<p>For goethite powder: <br>  Bimodal grain size distribution: <br>    mode 1: avg. grain size = 227 &#181;m @ 30 vol% <br>    mode 2: avg. grain size =   5 &#181;m @ 70 vol% <br><p>   avg. grain size = 125 &#181;m<p>No visible impurities; large fibrous grains are 90% coated with finer grains.  High relief, moderate red pleochroism, prismatic cleavage. All this is consistent  with pure goethite. G. Swayze.<p>END_MICROSCOPIC_EXAMINATION.<p>SPECTROSCOPIC_DISCUSSION:<p>Spectrum has Fe-related absorptions characteristic of goethite.  Bands arelocated at 0.5010, 0.6655, and 0.9412 microns.  Of note is the narrow width ofthe 0.9412 micron band:  it is only 250 nm wide -- much narrower than inspectra of powdered goethite samples.  Apparently the band narrows most on thelong wavelength side of this band in coatings.<p>END_SPECTROSCOPIC_DISCUSSION.<p>SPECTRAL_PURITY:  1a2_3_4_     # 1= 0.2-3, 2= 1.5-6, 3= 6-25, 4= 20-150 microns</BODY></HTML>
